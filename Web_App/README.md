# Computer Vision (Web App)
This directory includes all the files needed for running the web app. The object detection and classification is done using YOLOv5 (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).
The stream taken from the webcam is processed for object detection and the output is shown with bounding boxes (with labels).
Besides the output stream, the number and type of objects is listed. The background of this window turns red if any cell-phone is detected in the video stream.
